## Project Summary

Our project, "Watchful Eye LA" focuses on providing a comprehensive tool for law-abiding citizens in Los Angeles to stay informed about local crimes. We are utilizing a dataset containing crime information in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, which is sourced from the Los Angeles Police Department's crime logs.

The data in our database includes information such as the type of crime, victim descriptions, weapons used, and crime locations. Our web application's primary goal is to offer knowledge and awareness about crime trends. We intend to store attributes that help us uncover patterns within the vast amount of crime data, including crime types, victim profiles, weapons used, and crime locations.
